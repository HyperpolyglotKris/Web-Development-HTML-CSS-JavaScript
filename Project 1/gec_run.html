            </h1>
            <p>
                The GEC running program is designed is to guide and motivate runners to a personal best in their run
                training
                and racing. The training program is heavily coached and has a moderately aggressive approach to
                achieving
                your personal best. We will educate you on proper running form, biomechanics, training, nutrition
                and
                mental
                toughness.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will work with a GEC coach twice weekly to help you accomplish your goals and you'll have the
                companionship of others reaching for similar goals. At times, we'll have assistant coaches to
                decrease
                the
                coach to athlete ratio for a higher quality experience. Spend your workouts completing track
                workouts,
                hills
                repeats tempo runs, strength/power running, endurance strength training, and more. Each week will
                challenge
                you, and be tailored towards your goals from sprint races, 5K runs, or full-distance marathons.
            </p>
