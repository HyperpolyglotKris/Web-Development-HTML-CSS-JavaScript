                    Our Philosophy

                <p>
                    Athletes are the foundation of every successful training program. The best coach is an experienced
                    guide
                    who
                    begins with each athlete's hopes, dreams and desires and then tailors a training plan based on that
                    individuals’s current fitness and lifestyle. Since 2012, GEC has helped hundreds of individuals
                    achieve
                    success in many fitness areas. The winner is not the one who finishes first but anyone who starts
                    the
                    race
                    and perseveres. Join us and begin exploring the possible.

                You do it right! Your track record proves it. Proud to be a GEC athlete and I'm honored to have you all

                The coaches at GEC treat you with the highest respect: whether you're an individual getting off the
                couch
                for the first time or an elite athlete training for the Iron Man. They know their stuff.

                I just completed my first marathon, following your fitness schedule to the letter. Never once did I come
                close to bonking and two days later I felt ready for another race!
